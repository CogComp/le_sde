## Reproducing Experiments
### Dependencies
 
 We use Python 3.8 and ``pytorch`` for training neural nets, please use 
 ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (potentially in
 a virtual environment) to install dependencies.

### Datasets

  We use a dataset of geometric shapes (GeoMNIST) we constructed as well as CIFAR-10.
  GeoMNIST is lightweighted and will be generated when simulation runs; CIFAR-10 will
  be downloaded from ``torchvision``.

### Code Structure
  
  After instsalling the dependencies, one may navigate through the two
  Jupyter notebooks for running experiments and producing plots and figures.
  Below we outline the code structure.

  More info regarding ``npy`` files can be found in the [``numpy`` documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html).

## Reproducing Figures

### Experiment Data

  Although all simulations can be run on your machine, it is quite time-consuming.
  Data from our experiments can be downloaded from the following **anonymous** Dropbox links:
  
  - [lesde_exp_data.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmn08oquefkxqvr/lesde_exp_data.tar.gz?dl=1) (1.02GB): ``*.csv`` files for reproducing Figures 1-4.
  - [lesde_sim_data.tar.gz](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q1ruxc674ye6b3b/lesde_sim_data.tar.gz?dl=1) (2.54GB): ``*.npy`` files for reproducing Figure 5.

  After downloading those tarballs, extract them into ``./exp_data`` (or change the ``EXP_DIR``
  variable in the notebooks accordingly).

  
### Plotter

  Once experiment data are ready, simply follow ``LE-SDE Data Analysis.ipynb`` for
  reproducing all figures.
